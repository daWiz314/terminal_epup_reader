# terminal_epup_reader
 
I know it's spelled wrong, to be honest, I don't really care.
Once I realized it, that's how it is going to stay for this project, I'll fix it on the next project!

The purpose of this project is literally just to read E-Pubs in the terminal.
Not only will we read them, the idea is to have a fully functioning book reader in the terminal. Once I get this all fleshed out, I'll build an actual GUI but that will be a seperate project.
